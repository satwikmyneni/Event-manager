## Overview
This document provides comprehensive demo scenarios to showcase Project Drishti's AI-powered situational awareness capabilities.

## Demo Setup

### Prerequisites
- Deployed Project Drishti system
- Sample video feeds or camera simulators
- Test emergency units configured
- Demo social media data

### Mock Data Generation
Use the following script to generate realistic demo data:

```javascript
// Generate mock camera feed data
const generateMockCameraData = () => {
  return {
    cameraId: 'CAM-DEMO-001',
    location: 'Main Stage Area',
    coordinates: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
    timestamp: new Date(),
    imageBuffer: generateMockImageBuffer(),
    metadata: {
      resolution: '1920x1080',
      fps: 30,
      coverageArea: 1000
    }
  };
};
```

## Scenario 1: Predictive Crowd Management

### Setup
- **Location**: Music festival main stage
- **Time**: 30 minutes before headliner performance
- **Initial Conditions**: Moderate crowd density (60%)

### Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Normal Monitoring
```bash
# Simulate normal crowd monitoring
curl -X POST https://your-functions-url/processVideoFrame \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "imageBuffer": "base64_encoded_crowd_image",
    "cameraMetadata": {
      "cameraId": "CAM-MAIN-STAGE",
      "location": "Main Stage Area",
      "coordinates": {"lat": 37.7749, "lng": -122.4194},
      "coverageArea": 1000
    }
  }'
```

#### Step 2: Density Increase Detection
- System detects increasing crowd density (75% â†’ 85%)
- AI predicts potential overcrowding in 18 minutes
- Dashboard shows yellow warning indicators

#### Step 3: Predictive Alert Generation
```json
{
  "alert": {
    "type": "PREDICTIVE_CROWDING",
    "severity": "WARNING",
    "message": "High risk of overcrowding predicted in 18 minutes",
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "recommendations": [
      "Deploy crowd control barriers",
      "Open alternative viewing areas",
      "Announce crowd dispersal messages"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Proactive Response
- Security teams receive automated notifications
- Suggested crowd diversion routes displayed on map
- Real-time updates as situation evolves

### Expected Outcomes
- 18-minute advance warning achieved
- Proactive crowd management prevents dangerous overcrowding
- Smooth event flow maintained

## Scenario 2: Emergency Response Coordination

### Setup
- **Location**: Food court area
- **Emergency Type**: Medical emergency
- **Available Units**: 2 medical, 3 security, 1 fire crew

### Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Emergency Report
```bash
# Report medical emergency via mobile app
