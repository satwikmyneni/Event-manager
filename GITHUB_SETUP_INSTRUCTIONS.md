# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions for Project Drishti

## ✅ Current Status
Your Project Drishti files have been successfully prepared and committed locally! All 52 files are ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## 🔐 Authentication Required

GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication. Here's how to complete the setup:

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"

2. **Configure Token**
   - **Note**: "Project Drishti Deployment"
   - **Expiration**: Choose your preferred duration
   - **Scopes**: Select these permissions:
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
     - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages)

3. **Generate and Copy Token**
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Open terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
cd "/mnt/e/1Public safety/project-drishti"

# Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for username and token)
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username**: `i-suhas`
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

### Step 3: Alternative - SSH Setup (Recommended)

For easier future pushes, set up SSH authentication:

1. **Generate SSH Key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
   - Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
   - Paste the key and save

3. **Update Remote URL**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:i-suhas/project-drishti.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   - The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run on pushes
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository

### 4. **Configure Branch Protection**
   - Go to: Repository Settings → Branches
   - Add protection rules for the `main` branch

## 🚀 Local Development

After GitHub setup, continue local development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
